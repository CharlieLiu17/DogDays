# Dog Days

Dog Days is a vgDev Project.

## What is Dog Days?

Dog Days was a Spring 2021 vgDev game, led by Charlie Liu. It is a 3D social simulation game, inspired by games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. You play as 2 dogs, Kali and Kobe, and get to live and explore a dog's life. Quests await for the player around the neighborhood! It's a great game for when you want to relax to some peaceful music and just walk around like you don't have a care in the world.

Dog Days was built with the Unity game engine and written in C#. All assets were either created by the members of vgDev or retreived from the Unity Asset Store.
