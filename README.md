# Dog Days
Dog Days vgDev Project

Dog Days was a Spring 2021 vgDev game, led by Charlie Liu. It is a 3D social simulation game, inspired by games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. You play as 2 Dogs, Kali and Kobe, and get to live and explore a dog's life. There are quests in the house and around the cul-de-sac to do! It's a great game for when you want to relax to some peaceful music and just walk around like you don't have a care in the world.

Dog Days was built with the Unity game engine and written in C#. All assets were either created by the members of vgDev or retreived from the Unity Asset Store.
